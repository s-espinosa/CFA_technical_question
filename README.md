#CFA Technical Question Response

This application was prepared in response to Code for America's technical question (more details [here](http://codeforamerica.applytojob.com/apply/NfQ4F2)) and provides a high level analysis of building code violations.

In order to run, clone this repo and run the following command from the terminal.

```ruby violations.rb Violations-2012.csv```

Ideally, I would pursue some additional refactoring around moving the data through the class prior to printing, and saving to a file for later review. However, given the time constraints this is a decent first-run implementation.
